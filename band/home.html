                Robby Krieger played guitar, John Densmore played drums, 
                Ray Manzarek played keyboards, and Jim Morrison sang 
                in the American rock group The Doors, 
                which was founded in 1965 in Los Angeles, California. 
                After meeting at UCLA's film school, Morrison and Manzarek 
                decided to start a band and quickly enlisted Krieger and Densmore. 
                The Doors' 1967 self-titled debut album, which included the popular 
                song "Light My Fire," launched them to stardom. The band, which combined rock, 
                blues, and psychedelic elements in their music, gained fame in the late 1960s 
                for Morrison's creative lyrics, captivating stage presence, and eccentric demeanor. 
                In 1969, Morrison was arrested for indecent exposure during a concert in Miami, 
                leading to a decline in the band's mainstream acceptance
                The band's iconic era came to an end in 1971 when Morrison passed away in Paris 
                at the age of 27 from unspecified causes. Before breaking up in 1973, the remaining
                members remained together as a trio for two more albums. The Doors' songs, such as 
                Riders on the Storm, Break On Through, and People Are Strange, are still well-known 
                today despite Morrison's passing.
